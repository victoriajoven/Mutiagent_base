# 🪐 Mars Mission Report

## 🧪 Scientific Goals

- Collect subsurface samples from **rocky terrain** near nodes **N12**, **N45**, and **N78**.
- Analyze ice composition in **icy terrain** at nodes **N22** and **N23**.
- Capture panoramic images of **crater terrain** at node **N5**.
- Measure radiation levels in **sandy terrain** at node **N90**.

---

## ⚙️ Operational Constraints

- **Rovers** must recharge if energy drops below **30%**.
- **Drones** must return to base after **25 minutes** of flight.
- **Satellites** must maintain communication with base station at **N1** every **2 hours**.
- **No agent** may operate in terrain classified as **unstable** or **radioactive**.

## 🎯 Mission Priorities

1. **High Priority**  
   - Ice analysis at **N22–N23**  
   - Radiation measurement at **N90**

2. **Medium Priority**  
   - Subsurface sampling at **N12**, **N45**, **N78**

3. **Low Priority**  
   - Panoramic imaging at **N5**
