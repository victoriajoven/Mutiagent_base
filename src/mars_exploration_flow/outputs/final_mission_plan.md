# Mission Summary
A comprehensive mission strategy for the Mars exploration involving rovers and drones to achieve scientific goals while mitigating identified risks.

# Coordinated Actions
- Vehicle Id: Rover1, Action: Collect rock samples near Node N12, Time Window: Immediate
- Vehicle Id: Rover2, Action: Drive towards Node N45, Time Window: Within 2 hours
- Vehicle Id: Drone1, Action: Fly over Node N78 to take aerial images, Time Window: After Rover2 arrives at Node N45
- Vehicle Id: Drone2, Action: Approach Node N22 for ice composition analysis, Time Window: Simultaneous with Rover1's rock sample collection at Node N12
- Vehicle Id: Satellite, Action: Maintain communication with base station and vehicles every 2 hours, Time Window: Continuous throughout the mission

# Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Ensure frequent communication between vehicles to coordinate actions and respond to potential issues.
- Implement automated safety systems on rovers and drones to prevent accidents during operations in potentially hazardous terrains.
- Plan multiple routes for each vehicle to account for potential obstacles or unexpected terrain conditions.
- Establish emergency protocols for vehicle repairs, including onboard repair capabilities and backup vehicles if possible.
- Regularly monitor weather conditions at each node to avoid deploying vehicles during frequent dust storms.
